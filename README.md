# About
**Metal Fences** is a Minecraft mod adding iron and copper variants of fences and fence gates. They have similar properties to other metal blocks: iron fence gate cannot be opened by hand, while copper variants oxidize and can be waxed.

They're crafted in a similar way to vanilla fences, but instead of planks, ingots are used, and in case of iron variants, instead of sticks, iron nuggets are used.

See [galery](https://modrinth.com/mod/metal-fences/gallery) for craftings.

**[Iron Fences](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iron-fences)** - Similar mod, but for older versions. If you need metal fences for them, then check out this mod. Note that creation of Metal Fences was inspired by Iron Fences, but it isn't a fork of it, nor it uses its source code.

**[Iron Door Key](https://modrinth.com/mod/iron-door-key)** - My other mod that will allow you to open iron fence gate without using redstone.
